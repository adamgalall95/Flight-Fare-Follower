## Data Limitations

* PER (Perth Airport) data does not pull through
* Maximum 15 day duration on return flights
* 180 days in the future max

## Assumptions
* Pricing trends will be consistent across Australia to major US airports
* Day of the week of looking will affect pricing, a cheap day- hence daily calling
* Day of the week of travelling will affect pricing, iterate through 9-15 day return for all possible day of week combinations
* Time of year matters - using the data from Feb 1 to July 1
